Refactored C# Code for Conway badlife Test


I have refactored the code and provided comments at various places. 

I have used Depedency Injection and Solid Principles in refactoring the Code. 

Have also changed the way the Neighbours are counted provided a generic way which is a part of NeighboursCount concrete class.

Unfortunatley didn't have much to write UnitTests and may be  more code refactoring. 

But have tried my best in given time. 

Thanks for letting me take the test.
